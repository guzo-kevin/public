## Realtime output from Shell command

Copied from [here](https://zaiste.net/realtime_output_from_shell_command_in_python/)

Running a shell command in Python usually waits until the process is finished and only then sends its entire output. In the following example it is process.communicate() that blocks till given command is completed.
```
import subprocess
import shlex

command = shlex.split("ping -c 5 google.com")
process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
output, err = process.communicate()
print output
```
subprocess module allows to capture realtime output as well - here's how:

```
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def run(command):
    process = Popen(command, stdout=PIPE, shell=True)
    while True:
        line = process.stdout.readline().rstrip()
        if not line:
            break
        yield line


if __name__ == "__main__":
    for path in run("ping -c 5 google.com"):
        print path
```
