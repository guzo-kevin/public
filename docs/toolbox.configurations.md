# VS Code (1.33)

__Where is the settings.json__

* The settings are stored in settings.json
* It seemed the User/Master settings.json is in C:\Users\~\AppData\Roaming\Code\User
* Each directory can have .vscode\settings.json, which is also called workspace setting
* There are 2 ways to change setting, both can be launched through command panel \<ctrl-p\>. Both some settings, i.e Termial Args can only be set in Json.
    1. \> Preference: Open Setting (UI)
    2. \> Preference: Open Setting (JSON)
  

### Python environment

* In this configuration I used one of the virtual environment created in Anaconda
```
{
    "python.pythonPath": "C:\\Users\\username\\Programs\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\main\\python.exe"
}
```
### Terminal

* in this configuration I create a anaconda shell goes directly into "main" virtual environment 
```
{
    "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
    "terminal.integrated.shellArgs.windows": [
        "/K","C:\\Users\\username\\Programs\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\Scripts\\activate.bat C:\\Users\\username\\Programs\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\main"
    ]
}
```

### Terminal - with Shell Launcher

* I need to use different type of shell for different needs. So I installed an extention called "Shell Launcher"
* I put following in user settings.json
```
{
    "shellLauncher.shells.windows": [
        {
            "shell": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
            "args": ["/K", "C:\\Users\\username\\Programs\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\Scripts\\activate.bat C:\\Users\\username\\Programs\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\main"],
            "label":"Anaconda Main",
            "launchName":"Anaconda Main",
        },
        {
            "shell": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
            "label":"Cmd",
            "launchName":"Windows Cmd",
        },
        {
            "shell": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe",
            "label":"PowerShell",
            "launchName":"PowerShell",
        },
        {
            "shell": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
            "label":"Git Bash",
            "launchName":"Git Bash",
        },
    ]
}
```

* I still need to customize the "terminal.integrated.shell.windows". Otherwise the default terminal when I press control-` will get me a Powershell window, which I don't know much about.
  * Note: the argument for git bash is "l" like lower case "L", not "1" 
```
{
    "shellLauncher.shells.windows": [
        {
            "shell": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
            "args": ["/K", "C:\\Users\\username\\Programs\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\Scripts\\activate.bat C:\\Users\\username\\Programs\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\main"],
            "label":"Anaconda Main",
            "launchName":"Anaconda Main",
        },
        {
            "shell": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
            "label":"Cmd",
            "launchName":"Windows Cmd",
        },
        {
            "shell": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe",
            "label":"PowerShell",
            "launchName":"PowerShell",
        },
        {
            "shell": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
            "label":"Git Bash",
            "launchName":"Git Bash",
        },
    ],

    "terminal.integrated.shellArgs.windows": [
        "-l"
    ],

# Oracle sqlcl (18.4)

* I installed SQL CL, which does not work with MINGW64 terminal (git bash) very well. 

* I modified ~/Programs/sqlcl/bin/sql and added MINGW64* line in following section
```
        #
        # Check for Cygwin
        #
        cygwin=false
        case `uname` in
                CYGWIN*) cygwin=true;;
                MINGW64*) cygwin=true;;
        esac
```

# Oracle SQL Developer (18.4)
* I installed jtds jdbc client for SQL Developer to connect to SQL Server
  * the MS SQL Server JDBC 7.2 does not work with SQL Developer 
  * the SSO (dll) need to be in system path environment in order for Windows Integrated Authentidation to work
* I also installed SQL-cli, which is a modern SQLPlus using JDBC


# mssql-cli

##  I installed [mssql-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/mssql-cli?view=sql-server-2017) on my laptop. It work well but it breaks my Anaconda jupyter environment. I had to stop using it. 

### No I should not say it breaks the Jupyter, but given it uses the python environment I used for python development, I don't know a way to specify an interpreter for mssql-cli yet.  

# Python/Anaconda Environment

* I installed Anaconda Python 3.7 64-bit 2018.12 for Windows
* I created a virtual environment called "main", the default environment is "base(root)"
* In main I installed:
  * cx_oracle (for oracle)
  * pyodbc (for sql server)
  * m2-util-linux (for utilities)
  * numpy, matplotlib, pandas
  * jupyter
  * Pyspark
* to set Jupyter environment, in home directory:
  ```
  jupyter notebook --generate-config
  ```
  It will generate .jupyter\jupyter_notebook_config.py, change the parameters in the file



# git bash (2.2)


* 2020/03/06 update

It has been a frustration that anaconda put /cygdrive in all of its PATH.  I tried to write script to remove the /cygdrive but it will not work when switch env. 

I end up modify /etc/fstab ( need to run as administrator), so that c is actually mounted as /cygdrive/c. (git-bash by default mount it as /c ). This will make the conda stuff work. 

the only cavity is I when I run python, i need to run "winpty python"

modify 
```
none / cygdrive binary,posix=0,noacl,user 0 0

to 

none /cygdrive cygdrive binary,posix=0,noacl,user 0 0

```

ente 2020/03 update
# 

* Set the .bash_profile
  * (no longer valid, see 2020/03/06 update) set the python environment to Anaconda 'main' env
  ```
  export PYTHONPATH=/c/Users/username/Programs/Continuum/anaconda3/envs/main
  export PATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PYTHONPATH/Scripts:$PATH
  ```
  * set aliass
  ```
  alias sql='sql user/pass@service'
  alias sqlcmd='sqlcmd -S server_name  -d database'
  alias mssql-cli='mssql-cli -S server_name -d database -E'
  # -E is for integrated authentication
  ```



* Split window/terminal with tmux [Here](https://blog.pjsen.eu/?p=440) 

    * install msys2 (actually we just need 2 files from this install)
    * in msys2 terminal pacman -S tmux
    * copy tmux.exe and msys-event-*.dll to git /usr/bin (C:\Program Files \Git\user\bin, or /minw64\bin  I copied to both and did not spend time to find out which one actually is useful)
    * run tmux in terminal
    * use the shortcut to operate
    * =
    * the approach did not work initially. I tried to install a newer version 2.3 git to see if the version matters. Then I find out i actually have not been using the git-bash, what I used was git + cmd, which is why tmux did not work.  I chose the option to use git-bash during the git 2.3 installation and the previously deployed tmux worked. 
  

##  Merge in command line (need to verify)

I have 3 branches, master, office, and home. Let's say home is behind master:

1. commit all changes in home if any
2. git checkout master; git pull (so local master is up to date)
3. git checkout home (back to home branch)
4. git merge master (catch up)
5. git push (let remote know these 2 branches are merged)


## git proxy

use following commands to switch proxy

```
alias gitoffice='git config --global http.proxy http://10.76.225.15:80'
alias githome='git config --global --unset http.proxy'
```


# vim

These are the tricks I can never remember. So I write it down here
```
  * same line non-greedy match .\{-}
  * multi line non-greedy match \_.\{-}
```

For example if I want to match
```
Alter table abc
    drop constrains...
    ...
Go
```

I would use:
```
/Alter \_.\{-}GO
```
