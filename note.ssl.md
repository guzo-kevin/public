## SSL/TLS 

Assume I know the difference between SSL and TLS. I use SSL as the term for TSL

### concept

PKI - Public Key Infrastructure, this terminalogy is used to imply the whole mechanism of public/private key based framework

Cert - It's wellknown what the public/private keys are. The cert is the public key + some meta data like who issued it, expiration data, server name (or wildcard of server names like *.wikipedia.org), etc.... 

When a client contact server, server reply with a server cert, so that client can encrypt messages that only server will understand (decrypt), then client reply with the client cert (session key/cert) so the server knows how to reply messages encrypted for only this client. 

Cert can be stored in different encoding, namely DEM, JKS, PEM. They can be converted between each other

- Wildcard Certificates - the cert apply to many servers, like *.wikipedia.org
- SubjectAlternativeName(SAN) Certificates - for a group of servers for HA failover purpose

Certificate Signing Request (CSR) vs Certificate - A CSR or Certificate Signing request is a block of encoded text that is given to a Certificate Authority when applying for an SSL Certificate. It is usually generated on the server where the certificate will be installed and contains information that will be included in the certificate such as the organization name, common name (domain name), locality, and country. It also contains the public key that will be included in the certificate. A private key is usually created at the same time that you create the CSR, making a key pair. A CSR is generally encoded using ASN.1 according to the PKCS #10 specification. [link](https://www.sslshopper.com/what-is-a-csr-certificate-signing-request.html)

#### The utility to display server cert
- The following command display all returns from server
  ```
  $ openssl s_client -connect wikipedia.org:443 
  ```
- The following command displays only subject and issuer. x509 is a format standard. -noout means don't display keys
  ```
  $ openssl s_client -connect wikipedia.org:443 | openssl x509 -noout -subject -issuer
  ```
- [command line explain 1](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Command_Line_Utilities)
- [command line explain 2](https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-openssl-commands.html)

- Display Cert expiration dates
  ```
  openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout
  openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in /opt/cloudera/security/pki/$(hostname -f)-server.cert.pem
  ```

#### Convert between cert encodings

Note, DER Encoding is not readable as plain text no matter the file extension of .der .crt .cer.  PEM is readable.

- Convert a DER file (.crt .cer .der) to PEM
  ```
  openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem
  ```
- Convert a PEM file to DER
  ```
  openssl x509 -outform der -in certificate.pem -out certificate.der
  ```
- Convert a PKCS#12 file (.pfx .p12) containing a private key and certificates to PEM
  ```
  openssl pkcs12 -in keyStore.pfx -out keyStore.pem -nodes
  ```
- You can add -nocerts to only output the private key or add -nokeys to only output the certificates.

- Convert a PEM certificate file and a private key to PKCS#12 (.pfx .p12)
  ```
  openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.crt -certfile CACert.crt
  ```

- Convert between JKS and PEM can't happen directly. It need to use both keytoo and openssl, and interim format PKCS12 that both tools understand
  ```
  # from JKS to PEM

  $ keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/hostname-keystore.jks  -srcstorepass password -srckeypass password -destkeystore /tmp/hostname-keystore.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12 -srcalias hostname -deststorepass password -destkeypass password

  $ openssl pkcs12 -in /tmp/hostname-keystore.p12 -passin pass:password  -nokeys -out /opt/cloudera/security/pki/hostname.pem
  ```
  ```
  # from PEM to JKS

  $ openssl pkcs12 -export -in /opt/cloudera/security/pki/hostname.pem -inkey /opt/cloudera/security/pki/hostname.key -out /tmp/hostname.p12 -name hostname -passin pass:password -passout pass:password

  $ keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore /tmp/hostname.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass password -alias hostname -deststorepass password -destkeypass password -destkeystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/hostname-keystore.jks

  ```
  ```
  # Extract private key from pkcs keystore

  $ openssl pkcs12 -in /tmp/hostname-keystore.p12 -passin pass:password -nocerts -out /opt/cloudera/security/pki/hostname.key -passout pass:password

  # Generate key without password

  $ openssl rsa -in /tmp/hostname-keystore.p12 -passin pass:password -nocerts -out /opt/cloudera/security/pki/hostname.pem
  ```
    


#### Create CSR
- Create CSR with key, key length is recommanded to be longer than 2048. -keyout is the name for private key. -out is the name for csr
  ```
  openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -out servername.csr -keyout servername.key
  ```
- Decode a CSR
  ```
  openssl req -in server.csr -noout -text
  ```
- Generate a self-signed certificate 
  ```
  openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privateKey.key -out certificate.crt
  ```

- Generate a certificate signing request (CSR) for an existing private key 
  ```
  openssl req -out CSR.csr -key privateKey.key -new
  ```
- Generate a certificate signing request based on an existing certificate 
  ```
  openssl x509 -x509toreq -in certificate.crt -out CSR.csr -signkey privateKey.key
  ```


## Java Keystore and Truststore

(Java) Clients in Cloudera Manager need to check if a received server cert is trusted. It can verify it with default truststore (cacerts) or, alternative truststore, jssecacerts. Inistially we can copy cacerts to jssecacerts so the alternative store contains all the CA information, then add more certs need to be trusted jssecacerts

Note the keystore and truststore may comprise the same file, keystore is for **server** side and truststore is for client side. In Cloudera, each cluster hosts should have its own keystore, or share the same keystore.

Keystore will contain private key, truststore does not

When a server daemon starts, it load keystore.
