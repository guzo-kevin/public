# Keys

* ssh
   - id_rsa
   - id_ecdsa
   - *.pub

* OpenSSl
   - priv.key
   - pubkey.pem
   - key.der
   - example.com.crt
   - cert.pem (cert)
   - csr.pem (intermediary request for cert)
   - fullchain.pem (when include authority chains)

* formats

   - PEM is simply a base64 encoded DER file (with a plain-text header and footer)
   - DER is the binary format of ASN.1, more or less a dark-ages BSON
   - (you colud say DER is to UTF-8 as ASN.1 is to Unicode)
   - ASN.1 would then be a sort of dark-ages object notation for anything
   - X.509, then, is a dark-ages schema that uses ASN.1 to describe a specefic, concrete thing

* public key finger print (RFC1321)

   The security of the SSH protocols relies on the verification of
   public host keys.  Since public keys tend to be very large, it is
   difficult for a human to verify an entire host key.  Even with a
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in place, it is useful to have a
   standard for exchanging short fingerprints of public keys.

   for example:
   ```
   c1:b1:30:29:d7:b8:de:6c:97:77:10:d7:46:41:63:87
   ```

# SSH Private Key

OpenSSH and OpenSSL used to use the same format for private key. But OpenSSH started to use its own format. 

* OpenSSL Key is like this:

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGHAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBG0wawIBAQQgiYydo27aNGO9DBUW
eGEPD8oNi1LZDqfxPmQlieLBjVShRANCAAQhPVJYvGxpw+ITlnXqOSikCfz/7zms
yODIKiSueMN+3pj9icDgDnTJl7sKcWyp4Nymc9u5s/pyliJVyd680hjK
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----

or 

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAxhhbENu3NytrsWSUweH0y+UqI3JtzzzzoV0QqQm2CfikMR6p  

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```


* New OpenSSh key is like this:
```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
